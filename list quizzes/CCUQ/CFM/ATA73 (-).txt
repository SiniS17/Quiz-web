The CFM56 FADEC system of each engine consists of (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
An EEC, EIU, EVMU and its peripheral components and sensors.
@@A dual channel electronic control unit (ECU), with its associated peripherals.
A dual channel electronic control box (ECU) and an engine interface unit (EIU).

Before performing the operational test of the FADEC on GND (with Engine motoring), you must: (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
@@Make sure that the travel ranges of the flight control surfaces are clear before you motor the engine. Movement of the flight control surfaces can be dangerous and/or cause damage
Make sure that the safety pin is installed in the N/W-steering deactivation electrical-box. Movement of nose wheels can cause damage.
Make sure that the thrust reverser is locked. If not, the thrust reverser can operate accidentally and cause injury to personnel and/or damage to the reverser

The FADEC automatically selects a continuous relight: (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
In case of engine interface unit (EIU) failure only.
