How is the Alarm switch of Engine fire/overheat detector operate?  
Operating on the principle that pressure decrease with a rise in temperature. If ambient temperature around the sensor element increase, or a short section of the sensor element is exposed to intense heat, internal pressure in the sensor element and the responder housing will decrease
@@Operating on the principle that pressure increase with a rise in temperature.
