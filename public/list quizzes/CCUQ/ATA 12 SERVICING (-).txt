The HOT BUSS is energized for ten minutes only after you put the BATT POWER switch to the ON position.
HOT BUSS is always energized after you put the BATT POWER switch to the ON position.
You must put the BATT POWER switch to the ON position and hold it during refueling process

When you do the aircraft pressure refueling with manual control (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
Put the MODE SELECT switch to the REFUEL position
Put the REFUEL VALVES switch(es) for the applicable fuel tank(s) to the OPEN position and for the tank(s) which will not be refueled to the SHUT position.
Put the REFUEL VALVES switch(es) of all the fuel tank(s) to the OPEN position
A & B

When you do the aircraft pressure refueling without electrical power (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
The high-level protection system will not operate,
Do not refuel through the two refuel/defuel coupling at the same time
The handle of the refuel coupling cap must point aft when the cap is closed and locked.

The FWD, AFT cargo-compartment doors and the landing gear doors are opened
The FWD, AFT cargo-compartment doors are closed and the landing gear doors are opened
The FWD, AFT cargo-compartment doors are opened and the landing gear doors are closed

When doing the Hydraulic Fluid Reservoir Filling (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
The hydraulic system operating normally
The reservoirs air pressurize system must be depressurized
Do not depressurize the system reservoirs
Green hydraulic system must be depressurized

What happen if you fill to much hydraulic fluid in the reservoir? (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
Hydraulic system can not operate
A message "reservoir overfull" appear on ECAM
You cannot pressurize it the reservoir sufficiently and may cause the message "RSVR LO AIR PR" on ECAM.
Hydraulic fluid transfers to other reservoir.

After removal/installation of large hydraulic components. (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
You must fill in the related components with hydraulic fluid.
You must do the related bleeding procedure to make sure that the quantity of the hydraulic fluid in the system is correct and refill if necessary.
You must change the hydraulic fluid.
You must do the hydraulic sampling.

When filling the hydraulic fluid Reservoir with a hydraulic service cart, the maximum supply pressure is: (ME Repair, E&A Repair)

5 +0.3 -0 bar (50.7631 +4.3511 -0.0000 psi)
