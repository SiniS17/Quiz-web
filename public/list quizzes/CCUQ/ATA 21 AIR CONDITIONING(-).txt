How is the basic temperature regulation generated? (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
It corresponds to the lowest zone temperature demand,.
It adjusts the temperature in the three zones.
It corresponds to the highest zone temperature demand.

What is the function of the trim air valve? (ME Repair)
To optimize the zone temperature by adding cold air.
To optimize the zone temperature by adding hot air.
To regulate the hot air pressure.

What is the main purpose of the pack anti ice valve? (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
To stop the ice formation across the primary heat exchanger.
To stop the ice formation across the main heat exchanger.
To stop the ice formation across pack condenser.

What is the purpose of pack bypass valve? (ME Repair)
To reduce the air flow to the compressor stage.
To modulate the pack discharge temperature.
To increase the air flow to the turbine stage.

What is the purpose of the pack RAM AIR flaps? (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
To ensure cabin ventilation in case both packs fail.
To provide air to the pack compressor.
To modulate the main air flow through the heat exchangers.

What protects the packs from overheat condition? (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
Electrical sensor in the mixer unit
An overheat pneumatic sensor, two electrical sensors at compressor outlet
An electrical sensor at the water separator outlet
A differential pressure operated valve

Where do you check the correct manual landing elevation setting? (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
On ECAM “ CAB PRESS “ page
On the scale of LDG ELEV selector
On ECAM “ COND “ page
No need, because it is automatic ( From FMGC )

Where is the ventilation air expelled when both fans P/B are set to OVRD? (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
To the skin heat exchanger
Overboard

No ventilation. System is inoperative.

What is the purpose of the avionic ventilation skin heat exchanger? (ME Repair, E&A Repair)
To cool the air coming from the avionics equipment when Isolation valve is open.
To reheat air coming from avionics ventilation system
To cool air before it is ducted under the cargo compartment.
